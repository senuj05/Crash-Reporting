To examine the several factors that could affect traffic accidents, I examined the "Crash Reporting - Drivers Data" dataset from Montgomery County, Maryland, for this data science project. This dataset examined and offered a thorough examination of a number of factors related to traffic incidents, including as the time and date of collisions, posted speed limits, the kinds of cars involved, and the model and year of the vehicles. Examining the connection between the frequency of accidents and speed limits was one of the major analyses carried out. And as my question I anlyzed my data by asking whther a higher speed limit is associated with more accidents was explored as a hypothesis. In this hypothesis test's based on the results of the p- value, it revealed that the connection was not statistically significant. This concluded that there is no strong evidence to suggest a significant relationship between speed limit and the number of crashes.

In addtion to that, during this project I also added exploratory data analysis and visualizaion. In my analysis, it depicted that there is a tendancy showing that the newer car models are involved in fewer accidnets compared to older models. Also, another thing that i concluded was that there is higher chance of of happening an accident during the PM compared to AM, which I belive this results to be true in real life. The data visualisation successfully brought these trends to light and provided visual proof for the analytical conclusions. In addition my Python data manipulation and statistical analysis skills, this project gave me insightful knowledge about the variables influencing road safety, knowledge that will be used in future policy decisions and public awareness initiatives..
